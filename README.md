Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a data engineer passionate about building reliable, efficient and scalable data solutions â€” and simplifying complex data concepts for others along my learning journey.

I design and build data pipelines, architectures and analytics solutions that drive well-informed business decisions. My core tools include Python, SQL, Power BI, Microsoft Fabric, SQL Server and PostgreSQL, with a strong focus on cloud-based solutions using Microsoft Azure.

Before transitioning into data engineering, I worked across multiple domains in mechatronics â€” including embedded systems, drones, hardware design, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This cross-disciplinary background gives me a unique perspective on integrating physical systems with digital intelligence.
